My time spent on the SouthAmericanFBI was time I can never get back. Although I enjoyed my line of work, and I even committed
to it within 2 days of entering the business, it left a deep dark hole in my heart. I lost everything by the time I reached my 1 month 
anniversary on the job, and I hope to never endure a job like that again.
